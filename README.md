WFRP2e Foundry conversion from WFRP2E

## This is currently NOT working with the newest version of Foundry *(which is v10)*.

I do not promise that it will ever be finished. I'll try to make a conversion in my free time and - based on how challenging it's gonna be - I'm gonna either do it or not.

> Consider using the "Simple Worldbuilding" system as a stop-gap while your own system is still under development. This will allow you and your players to enjoy using the Virtual Tabletop while you work on completing your own system. When the time comes, the data for your World can be moved to your completed system.

Cheers for us - WFRP2e **gigachad** enjoyers!
